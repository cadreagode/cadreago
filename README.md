# Cadreago Hotel Booking

Cadreago is a modern single-page React experience that showcases a premium hotel booking journey. It includes:

- A discovery flow with filters, guest selector, shareable listings, and favorites
- A hotel details page with immersive gallery, services, room options, policy and reviews in one scrollable narrative
- A booking form that lets guests pick add-ons and see an itemized total including GST before checkout
- Guest and host dashboards with mock data to demonstrate future functionality

## Tech Stack

- React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling
- Lucide icons for consistent iconography
- React Scripts build tooling (Create React App)

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This runs the development server on <http://localhost:3000>. Use `npm run build` for production assets located in the `build/` directory.
